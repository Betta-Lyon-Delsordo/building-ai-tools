## 1) Intro
Betta Lyon Delsordo is a lead application penetration tester at OnDefend, and has built several AI tools for pentesting. These include an AI code review tool, and another for assisting with intel gathering. You can connect with her on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/betta-lyon-delsordo/.

## 2) Framing the AI tool problem
"AI pentesters" aren't there yet, and there are a lot of issues with these tools. Therefore, we will build our own niche tools to fit our own scenarios. 

## 3) Task Brainstorm
Instead of trying to build a whole "AI pentester", try to pick a very niche, repetetive task that you perform in your daily work that would benefit from AI assistance. 
Some ideas:
- OSINT
- Recon
- Code review
- Documentation review
- Digesting past pentest reports
- Cloud IAM policy review
- Application log review
- Known exploits
- Reporting (but with specific prompts)
- News feed analysis and industry updates
